React Fragments provide a way to group multiple children elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. They're especially useful when you don't want to add unnecessary divs or other elements just for the sake of grouping. Here's how you can use them:

### Fragments

1. **Usage of React Fragments:**
   - Using React Fragments allows you to return multiple elements from a component's render method without wrapping them in a parent element.
   - Fragments look like empty tags `<></>` or `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>`.
   - They don't create an extra DOM node.

Example:
```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

2. **Short Syntax for Fragments (Using Empty Tags):**
   - You can use empty angle brackets `<> </>` to represent a Fragment. This is a more concise syntax, especially for components returning multiple elements.

Example:
```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In both cases, the output will be the same:

```html
<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

Using Fragments can help keep your DOM structure clean and concise, especially when returning multiple elements from a component.
